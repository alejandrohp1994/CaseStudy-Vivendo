This currency was removed for calculation purposes. In addition, all amounts in this column were rounded to two decimal places.\n\n**amount_paid :** There were 1964 unique values, but there are 36 missing values on this column. As requested, these amounts were replaced with the overall median amount of this column. The amount was 20105.70.

RECIFE was the location having the most amount of claims. Approximately, 44.25 percent of the total claims. The office of SAO LUIS also receives a cosiderable amount of claims. SAO LUIS receives approximately 25.85 percent of the claims. FORTALEZA and NATAL are the two offices that receives the least amount of claims. 15.55 percent and 14.35 percent respectively. As the graph and percentages shows, the metrics are not balanced. Because RECIFE is receiving the most amount of claims, this location should be considered to be evaluated for process enhancement or personnel increase.\n","metadata":{},"id":"1d5ba38c-1b3a-4f9b-bf38-bb0a62dac346","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 3","metadata":{},"id":"ce5f6df2-fbf2-4c44-9209-9ee668876b53","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"Describe the distribution of time to close for all claims.

The average amount of days that takes to close a claim is 185.568 days. This number can be validated by looking at the graph. As the graph shows, most claim cases were closed within 150 and 200 days.\n\nIn addition, there are some claims that took over 248 days to close , however this is uncommon. When assessing what store to help first, the team should see what office has the amount of claims closed over the 248 day period without damaging overall performance.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f8045fb1-dc0e-4260-bc3e-0476e4d1b351"},{"source":"## Task 4","metadata":{},"id":"c5fbe3a0-d277-437c-a1a0-f1edf80684f7","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"Describe the relationship between time to close and location.

As we need more insights and less data noise we will remove the outliers that are beyond 400 so we can have a better understanding and view of the graph. As there are very few outliers passing the 400 mark, we will be ignoring these.","metadata":{},"id":"170dd2ea-340f-4ab4-94c8-fe077342e98e","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"![image-6](image-6.png)\n\nNow that we removed the points beyond the 400 mark, we can see all the stores have similar standards. In addition, we must consider the two stores that have the biggest amount of traffic are the RECIFE AND SAO LUIS. These two stores have the most amount of outliers. As discussed previously, RECIFE has the most amount of traffic (44.25 percent of 2000 claims received). Efforts to improve the claim process should be dedicated first to the store located in RECIFE.\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1037dff8-69ae-4470-9ccf-50c7a8a025eb"},{"source":"![image-7](image-7.png)\n\nFinally in this graph we can see the distribution of claims according to the time to close column. The amount of claims that fall in the 75% - 100% percentile  for the RECIFE location is almost the same amount of total claims received in the NATAL location. We can deduce that improving the RECIFE to the best of capabilities can possibly improve 14% of total claims. This is a great chart to observe when evaluating for possible improvements and enhancements.\n\nThe store located in SAO LUIS should also be asssessed right after making improvements to the store in RECIFE, as this is the second receiving the most amount of claims. Further analysis will be done after implementing the enhancements required to see the impact of the changes.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"72f437a2-80fe-4e15-88c3-1a30ec215eb3"},{"source":"## âœ… When you have finished...\n-  Publish your Workspace using the option on the left\n-  Check the published version of your report:\n\t-  Can you see everything you want us to grade?\n    -  Are all the graphics visible?\n-  Review the grading rubric.
